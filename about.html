            <p>Hi! I’m kf, a coding-inclined, <a href="http://catcatcatcatc.at">cat-inclined</a> twenty-something.</p>
<p><img src="images/kf-and-dallas-glitchy.png" alt="me and my cat" width="500" /></p>
<p>Currently, I work as a data engineer at <a href="https://simple.com">Simple</a> in Portland, OR. Previously, I worked on distributed systems at <a href="http://labs.comcast.com">Comcast</a> in Philly and as a freelance Scala developer for startups in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my time in industry working remotely, and I have a penchant for functional programming. I’ve taught workshops on Scala and Clojure, as well as given conference talks on developer workflows and community organizing.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I’ve been on the boards of <a href="http://clojurebridge.org">ClojureBridge</a> and <a href="http://bridgefoundry.org">Bridge Foundry</a>; helped organize <a href="http://phillyemergingtech.com">Philly ETE</a>, <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a>, and <a href="http://plibmttbhgaty.com">PLIBMTTBHGATY</a>; and started the Philly and Portland chapters of <a href="http://paperswelove.org">Papers We Love</a>. I was a key-holding member at <a href="https://doubleunion.org">Double Union</a> in San Francisco for several years, and I’m an alumni and former mentor of <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com">Hackbright Academy</a>, as well.</p>
<p>If you’d like to hear more about my work and background, you can <a href="contact.html">drop me a line</a> or check out my interviews on the <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/085">Cognicast</a> and <a href="http://bikeshed.fm/60">The Bike Shed</a>.</p>
